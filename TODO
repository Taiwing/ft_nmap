- Try and fix ACK scan false 'positive' tests, meaning all
  the ports on which the scan result ends up randomly
  filtered where the original nmap always says unfiltered.
  It does not happen often (like 3/4 times on 1024 ports)
  but it still makes the result false and unreliable. The
  ACK scan should get an RST response for ending up in an
  unfiltered state, then sometimes it must not receive
  the RST response, or indeed any response at all. Either
  that or it gets a icmp packet out of the blue...
- check other scan results too
- close every active pcap handle in exit cleanup handler
- adapt the filter to ipv6 for the icmp part (also maybe
  clean the function/divide it because it's messy)
- uncomment the 'exit if packet->size' in pcap handler
  to test if it still is used multiple times by thread
  (which it should not, it should stop to one packet)
- when all this is done, check that the scan results are
  the same as the original nmap and that it does not
  take too muche time to execute
- then stress-test the shit out of this program (really)
