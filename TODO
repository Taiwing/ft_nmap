- check potentially nested ft_exit calls (via ft_mutex functions for example)
- Maybe store the exit arguments in a global when exiting from a thread so
  that the error message is printed at the end of the program. This would
  require a modification of the ft_exit function so that it executes atexit
  thread handlers before printing the message. This is a very specific
  behavior though. It would be probably best to somehow make it an option.
