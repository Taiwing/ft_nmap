- close every active pcap handle in exit cleanup handler
- search and fix the reason of the non-exiting of some
  threads when doing a big number of scans
- adapt the filter to ipv6 for the icmp part (also maybe
  clean the function/divide it because it's messy)
- uncomment the 'exit if packet->size' in pcap handler
  to test if it still is used multiple times by thread
  (which it should not, it should stop to one packet)
- when all this is done, check that the scan results are
  the same as the original nmap and that it does not
  take too muche time to execute
- then stress-test the shit out of this program (really)
